\section{Introduction}
A chain of vegetarian/vegan restaurants based in North America is looking into expanding to Western Europe. They have asked for a report on vegetarianism/veganism in the capitals of Europe to decide which European cities to start with. 

This report will present a number of relevant statistics for West-European countries and their capitals. This includes the number of vegetarians/vegans as part of their population, the restaurant density in their city centers, the share of vegetarian/vegan restaurants versus meat-centered restaurants (e.g., steakhouse, Argentinian restaurant, BBQ restaurants). Based on this data, cities where the client's chain of vegetarian/vegan restaurants are likely to succeed will be identified. For the city where the client's restaurant is most likely to succeed, a further investigation is performed on a neighborhood level. 

This report will start with a description of the data used for this investigation in Section~\ref{sec:data}. Next, the methodology for the exploratory data analysis, statistical testing and machine learning techniques are explained in Section~\ref{sec:methodology}. Results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}, after which the report concludes with the discussion and conclusion in Sections~\ref{sec:discussion} and \ref{sec:conclusion}, respectively.
